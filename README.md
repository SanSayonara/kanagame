# Kana Game

A simple game I made to learn hiragana and katakana using good ol' and simple JavaScript/CSS/HTML before I sold my soul to the bloatware.

## How it works

It's a very simple game, if you type the correct answer in the input box the entire form will turn green for a brief moment, in the case the answer was incorrect it will turn temporarily red and as well will show you the correct answer.
